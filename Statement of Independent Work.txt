Statement of Independent Work

1A. Declaration of Original Work. By entering our Student ID below, we certify that we completed our assignment independently of all others (except where sanctioned during in-class sessions), obeying the class policy outlined in the introductory lecture. In particular, we are allowed to discuss the problems and solutions in this assignment, but have waited at least 30 minutes by doing other activities unrelated to class before attempting to complete or modify our answers as per the class policy.
